* About
The purpose of this package is to be able to play go online from a physical go board at home.

[[./physical_virtual_demo.gif]]

Unlike the many other repositories which can read go board images, this one is /really dumb/ and /really fast/. See the [[#developer-instructions][developer instructions]] below for how to modify the code to suit your needs.

This software can also be used to automatically interface between multiple virtual boards:
[[./virtual_virtual_demo.gif]]

** Features
+ A `Board()` object in [[goban_irl/board.py][board.py]] which takes in an image and corners of the board on that image and stores what stones are on the board and the positions of the intersections on the board subimage.
+ A [[goban_irl/ui.py][ui.py]] script which helps you load in two boards and plays stones with [[https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][pyautogui]] on first as they change on the second.

* Maintenance warning
Unfortunately I'm not in a place where I can take suggestions for features or review pull requests. However, the code here should be pretty readable, even for a novice Python programmer. If you have some functionality you'd like to see implemented or are fighting with a bug here, definitely feel free to fork this code. Also, if you message me directly with questions I'll try to get back to you.


* Developer instructions
** Install
I enjoy using [[https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge][miniforge]] for managing Python environments. You can install it from that link, and then create a virtual environment as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
  conda create -n goban_irl --file requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

After you ~conda activate goban_irl~, you can install the package locally in editable mode with

#+BEGIN_SRC 
  python -m pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

** Code Map
The key functionality of this code can be found in the ~Board~ class in [[goban_irl/board.py][board.py]]. The ~Board~ class expects two arguments:

  1. an ~image~ which can either be an OpenCV image or a path
  2. ~corners~, which should be a list of either two or four ~(x,y)~ pixel locations in that image. 

The corners are used to create a ~board_subimage~, a rectangle whose corners are exactly the playable corners of the go board. From there, the rest is easy

  + The ~intersections~ are just 19x19 evenly spaced points in that ~board_subimage~
  + The ~stone_subimage_boundary~ is the rectangle around each possible stone on that board
  + The ~detection_function~  takes in a stone subimage and returns a number. If the number is low we'll call the stone black, high we'll call it white, and anything in between should be the empty board. The cutoffs what we call black and white stones are named ~cutoffs~

So, to use this code, you just need to repeatedly load a ~Board~ with your image as it changes. An example of this can be found in [[goban_irl/ui.py][ui.py]] which loads in a physical board, a virtual board, and looks for what stones are missing on the virtual board.


** Stuff you might want to modify
While I run the code through ~python ui.py~, I tolerate its many deficiencies because I wrote it. Instead of using that script directly, I would recommend modifying it to suit your needs. Here are what I expect your pain points to be:

  + The user flow as written expects the user to provide the corners of the board. Detecting those corners automatically should not be hard, particularly for virtual boards.
  + The stone detection function is very lazy and doesn't take into account ambient light. This means when I play at different times of day, I usually need to re-calibrate the physical board. Different detection functions can be passed as input into the ~Board~ class, so it should be easy to write and insert your own better function.
  + The code which decides to when automatically click is a bit /enthusiastic/. This might be a problem for you if you plan to play online using this code and you might want to implement some validation (e.g. require that it detect a stone needs to be played more than one cycle in a row).

  
** Some useful things
The main important design decision here is to not care about the rules of Go beyond where stones should be placed. 

I'm also very happy that this only looks at screenshots of computer Go boards. While it would have been possible to interface with the API for various different projects, it's much easier to just look at a picture of the board and know what the color cutoffs for the stones should be. As a result, this code works with Sabaki, OGS, KGS, and probably any other virtual go resource.

I'm not thrilled with the decision here to use OpenCV. It's much heavier as an import than what is needed here, and it's not pleasant to use as a Python package. I couldn't find an easy way to not use it, but I'd be happy to take any recommendations for a way to replace it. Notably, version ~4.5.3~ was entirely broken for me hence the pinned version at ~4.5.2~.
